Teacher Denis Panjuta thanks to your course I`ve been able to create this converter following the steps and changing a couple of things https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-panjuta/?locale=de_DE

More info about it works in my Obsidian Notes Folder, you can find it here https://github.com/jtokz/Notes/blob/main/DOT_NET/Projects%20and%20Exercises/Currency%20Converter%20using%20an%20API.md

In order for the images to work, it's necessary to download the Images folder, but it's recommended to download the complete repository, there may be some things that can be useful to you
